kind: NOTES
body: The wrapper around the installed Terraform binary has been fixed to return the
  exact STDOUT and STDERR from Terraform when executing commands. Previous versions
  of setup-terraform may have required workarounds to process the STDOUT in bash,
  such as filtering out the first line or selectively parsing STDOUT with jq. These
  workarounds may need to be adjusted with `v3.0.0`, which will now return just the
  STDOUT/STDERR from Terraform with no errant characters/statements.
